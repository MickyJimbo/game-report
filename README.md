## Initial Idea of the project
After our first meeting we came up with a game design that we felt would both be challenging and interesting to make. The goal was to create a game with a character who could grapple and swing with the ability to change their own weight. Changing the characters weight would be the main way to interact with the puzzle elements of the game.

The concept for the game was simple but we felt it would allow for a lot of experimentation once we had the gameplay mechanics up and running.
## Team work
To make sure we were all on the same page we had several ways of arranging ourselves. At the beginning of each week we would have a team meeting where we would show the work that we had done and also discuss goals going forward into the next week. During the time when we couldn't be in the lab we would predominantly communicate using our slack channel. We also had a trello board set up but it went unused as the team meetings and the slack channel were sufficient for communication.

As we all had to take part in both programming and art for the project we initially decided that it would be a good idea to split up the tasks for various puzzle elements. A lot of ideas did not make it into the final game but here is a list of just a few that we discussed during our meetings:
- Platforms that would raise and lower based on your weight
- Breakable platforms
- Fans that would push you based on your weight
- Suction tubes that would only work if you are the correct weight
- Walls that would break when hit but only if you are heavy
- Pressure pads that only activates when you are heavy
- Movable swing objects
- Elevators at the end of the level that would only work if you were a certain weight 
- Timed doors and traps

However, people ended up gravitating more to certain tasks, for instance myself and Sam gravitated more to the programming whereas Ali, Nuno, Touraj and Rafael gravitated towards the art elements of the game.
## My Main Roles Within The Team
One of my main roles within the team was managing the github. This involved the initial setup, giving everyone contribution rights to the repository, making sure everyone's local repositories were set up correctly on their computers, and ensuring that everyone understood the right process for creating branches and merging into each other's work.  There were a few problems getting everyones machines to work with the github repository, however, we did eventually get a system where everyone could contribute. The main problems seem to be with getting Git LFS to work correctly on some machines.

The other main role that I had was in programming the swing mechanics, aiming mechanics and the button interaction mechanics. I spent a majority of my time experimenting with various methods to make sure that these gameplay mechanics were both fun and satisfying to use. I have gone into greater detail with this in my programming report that can be read [here](https://github.com/MickyJimbo/game-report/blob/master/programming.md).

I was involved with small amounts of modelling and texturing, the main being the button for the button mechanics, but I was also involved in setting up some simple dynamic instance materials as place holders for the game. Towards the end I was also largely involved with the lighting of the final MVP level which helped a lot with giving it it's final look.

## Designing The MVP Level

#### Initial MVP level design
![InitialDesign](https://github.com/MickyJimbo/game-report/blob/master/Screenshots/initialDesign.png)

We designed the MVP level during one of our team meetings, we gave ourselves a set of easily achievable puzzle elements that we could use within the game and then discussed how they could be used to make a compelling first level for our game.
The main goal for the MVP was to be able to give this game to someone who's never seen it before and have them be able to figure out how to progress through the level. By the time they came to the next level they would already know how to use every element in the game.
The MVP level consists of essentially five corridors. Each of the first four corridors introduce new gameplay elements as well as increasing difficulty. By the fifth corridor all of the gameplay elements have been introduced and the player will have to come up with creative use of these elements in order to complete the level.

#### Corridor 1

In the first corridor we introduce three gameplay elements, the first being the characters ability to swing, the second, that the fans will push your character, and the third, that you can change your character’s weight to reduce the effects of the fan. In between the first and second corridor we're also teaching the player that they need to reduce their weight in order to make longer jumps.

#### Corridor 2

In the second corridor we're teaching the player they need to be heavy in order to break the destructible wall. The player will also learn to chain swings together. Lastly, the player will also learn that they can change their weight during their swing.

#### Corridor 3

In the third corridor we're reuse the fans to show that they can also be useful. By positioning the fans differently the fans can be used as launch pads, however the player must be the correct weight for it to have the best effect. Being too heavy has no effect and being too light has too much effect, it requires the player to take better control of their character’s weight.

#### Corridor 4
![Corridor4](https://github.com/MickyJimbo/game-report/blob/master/Screenshots/corridors/corridor4.png)

In the fourth corridor we're introducing a weight controlled timed button that controls a laser grid on the other side of the corridor. If the player takes too long the laser grid will reactivate and potentially kill the player.

#### Corridor 5
![Corridor5](https://github.com/MickyJimbo/game-report/blob/master/Screenshots/corridors/corridor5.png)

In the fifth and final corridor we use all of the elements together. The character must be heavy in order to push the button that activates the timed door at the back of the room. The player must then shed weight to use the fan that launches them up high enough to reach the swing point. Finally the player must use a food source to regain weight to be able to break through the destructible wall on the other side of the door. The player must do this in a timely fashion otherwise the laser grid will reactivate and they will need to restart.
